this is a series of challenges used for the cognitive task analysis project named `challenge1.rb`, `challenge2.rb`, etc.

the challenges are ordered, more or less, from least to most difficult.

a challenge can be run just as you would expect:

`$ ruby challenge1.rb`

all challenges are self contained ruby scripts that do not rely on any external files, gems, etc.

each challenge may contain one (or MORE) bugs.  you should continue debugging each challenge until you are 100% satisfied that it is free of defects.

if you choose to stop debugging a challenge please explain your decision so the interviewer can understand your reasons.

of course you're welcome to use Google (or any other resources) to help you.

if it isn't too distracting for you, try to "think aloud" so the interviewer can follow your assumptions and thought process.
